# Anuwad - English to Marathi Translator

## Neural Machine Translation with TensorFlow

This repository contains a TensorFlow implementation of an Attention-based Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model named **Anuwad**. The model leverages the Bahdanau Attention mechanism to translate sentences from English to Marathi using a deep learning architecture.

## Implementation Architecture

### The Bahdanau Architecture

The architecture consists of the following components:

1. **The Encoder**: Processes the input sequence and produces a context-rich representation of the source sentence.
2. **The Decoder**: Generates the target sequence based on the context provided by the encoder and the previously generated tokens.
3. **The Bahdanau Attention Algorithm**: Allows the decoder to focus on different parts of the input sequence at each step of generation, improving translation quality.

### Flask UI

A Flask-based UI is provided for running the model locally. This interface allows users to input English sentences and view the corresponding Marathi translations.

## Results

Here are some sample translations produced by the model:

| Input Sequence (English)                               | Output Sequence (Marathi)                                |
|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| i like french                                          | मला फ्रेंच आवडते                                         |
| your cell phones not working                          | तुमचा सेलफोन चालत नाहीये                                |
| whats your favorite website                           | तुमचं आवडतं संकेतस्थळ कोणतं आहे                        |
| spanish is widely spoken in south america              | दक्षिण अमेरिकेत अमेरिकेत बोलली जाते                    |
| if hed known the truth hed have told me               | त्याला सत्य माहीत असतं तर त्याने मला सांगितलं असतं        |
